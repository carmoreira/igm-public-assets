# igm-public-assets

Public assets for the Interactive Geo Maps project

Wordpress site [my.igm](https://my.interactivegeomaps.com/) loads assets from this repository, served by cdn `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/interactive-geo-maps/igm-public-assets@<latest-stable-version>`

Once a new stable version of the [plugin](https://github.com/interactive-geo-maps/interactive-geo-maps) is released, the public assets will be copied to this repository otherwise the [my.igm](https://my.interactivegeomaps.com/) will load blank maps.
